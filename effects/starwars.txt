Let me tell you a story.
___

This portfolio was inspired by
Bruno Simon and Jesse-Zhou.

Back in 2020
when I just graduated from my university
and had my first job as a Data Analyst.

Until now
I am still in love with the data,
number, dashboard, visualization.

I also gained more and love more
through different positions:

- Data Analyst at Giaohangtietkiem
- IT Consultant at KPMG Vietnam
- Business Intelligence Analyst at Catthai
- Project Management at Roche Diagnostics
- and Developer at home.

I love turning data to insights,
insights to decisions,
decisions to business impact.

I love leveraging the art
of data storytelling.

I also love exploring more:
- Technical
- Design
- IoT
- and Management

I am always open to discuss, so
if you want to ask me anything
just send me a message :)

And currently, I am still open to new opportunities.
